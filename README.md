# AB-Testing-and-Hypothesis-Testing

## E-news Express Project

### Problem definition

-   An online news portal wants to perform an a/b test to see whether
    the new landing page to their website will acquire more subscribers
    compared to the old landing page.
-   The data from this test will aid the company in deciding if updates
    to their current system will improve their business.

### Objective

-   Explore the dataset and extract insights using Exploratory Data
    Analysis
-   Perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis
-   Key meaningful observations on individual varaibles and the
    relationship between the variables
-   Perform the statistical analysis and visual analysis
-   Generate recommendations to the company to acquire new subscribers
    by analysing their interest and determine the effectiveness of a new
    feature

### Questions to be answered

1.  Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than the old
    landing page?
2.  Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the
    landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the
    conversion rate for the old page?
3.  Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
4.  Is the mean time spent on the new page same for the different
    language users?

### Data background

-   The data is based on randomly selected 100 users, divided equally
    into two groups - control and treatment
-   The quality test is conducted with these groups of 50 users each;
    the old landing page is assigned to the control group and the new
    landing page to the treatment group.

### Contents of the dataset

-   user ID - ID of the user visiting the website
-   group - specifies the group (control/treatment) which the user
    belongs to
-   landing_page - the page (old/new) visited by the user
-   time_spent_on_the_page - time spent by the user on the landing page
-   converted - did the user become a subscriber or not
-   language_preferred - user's language preference of the page
